# 全量 PerformanceProfile 绑定矩阵
- 文档 ID：`DEV-PLAN-012`
- 版本：`1.0.0`
- 状态：`Normative`
- 目的：防止 AI 以“高性能/低延迟”等模糊词自行选择性能目标。所有 69 个 FS 均绑定唯一 PerformanceProfile 标识。

> 本表只规定性能测试入口和字段完整性，不制造硬件相关数值。真实吞吐、P95/P99、内存、CPU/GPU、冷启动和恢复目标必须由目标机器/产品的批准 Profile 关闭。

## 1. Profile 必须包含的字段

- ProfileId / Revision / ApplicableProduct / MachineClass / StationClass；
- workload definition、warm/cold condition、input size/ROI/FOV、batch/stream mode；
- throughput、latency P50/P95/P99、peak memory、CPU/GPU、queue depth、concurrency；
- timeout、cancel latency、restart/recovery budget；
- acceptance threshold、measurement method、sample count、confidence/reporting method；
- benchmark environment hash、software/driver/model/calibration versions。

## 2. AI 实施规则

1. 没有 Profile 数值时，AI 不得发明数值；可以先完成计时点、resource instrumentation、mock、contract 和测试 harness。
2. 不得以 UI 响应时间代替视觉/计量 pipeline latency。
3. 不得以单次最好值代替 P95/P99。
4. 不得通过降低覆盖、分母、采样或证据要求“优化”性能。
5. 性能优化后的语义结果必须回放一致或记录批准的非确定性来源。


## Blocker 与验收

- **Scope Freeze**：本计划只覆盖已登记的 FunctionSpec/PerformanceProfile；新增能力必须走变更控制。
- **Blocker**：缺 Contract/Schema、Owner/State、Profile、Golden/Replay、目标 API 或验收口径立即停止。
- **Test**：至少覆盖 Contract/Schema、正常、边界、失败/恢复、Replay/Golden、性能；适用时执行 HIL。
- **验收**：测试与性能证据必须与当前版本、配置、数据集和环境绑定；没有证据不得声明完成。

## Scope

覆盖 FS-001..FS-069 的 PerformanceProfile 绑定、度量字段、Benchmark harness、环境指纹和外部实测门禁；不伪造目标硬件性能数值。
