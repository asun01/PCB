## Feature execution contract

Each feature binds an inspection object, ROI/region, coordinate/reference frame, calibration identity, algorithm revision, parameters, threshold source, outcome semantics, evidence references, replay inputs and Quality contribution.

The detailed execution contract is defined in [FEATURE_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md](FEATURE_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md), with end-to-end traceability in [FEATURE_TRACEABILITY.md](FEATURE_TRACEABILITY.md).

## Decision semantics

PASS, FAIL, REVIEW, INCONCLUSIVE and NOT_EVALUATED are distinct concepts where the authoritative Result contract supports them. A missing measurement is not a zero value. An unavailable feature is not a passing feature.

## Feature implementation rule

A catalog entry is not implementation-ready until its detailed specification defines input, ROI/region, coordinate/reference semantics, pre-processing, algorithm boundary, measurement/finding output, parameter authority, invalid/failure semantics, Quality contribution, Evidence, Replay, UI and Program/Recipe interaction.

## Parameter authority

Parameters affecting production decisions require an identified authoritative source and revision. Device defaults may be displayed as descriptive defaults but cannot silently become production acceptance limits.

## Qualification status

All features remain Candidate until concrete device/model qualification evidence exists. The catalog does not assert that every 3D SPI machine supports every feature.
