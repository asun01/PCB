# 3D SPI — Golden Device Specification

Family: 03d-spi  
Modality: 3D solder-paste inspection  
Objects: solder-paste deposits before component placement

This directory is the current golden device-specification surface. It is intentionally deeper than the other device-family catalogs and is the template source for subsequent device-specific expansion.

## Specification surfaces

- [DEVICE_SPEC.md](DEVICE_SPEC.md) — device boundary, input, coordinate/calibration, lifecycle and authority.
- [CAPABILITIES.md](CAPABILITIES.md) — normalized capabilities and qualification states.
- [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) — feature catalog and implementation-readiness rule.
- [inspection-features/](inspection-features/) — one detailed specification per feature.
- [FEATURE_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md](FEATURE_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md) — normalized feature execution chain.
- [FEATURE_TRACEABILITY.md](FEATURE_TRACEABILITY.md) — end-to-end feature-to-client traceability.
- [MEASUREMENTS.md](MEASUREMENTS.md) — measurement semantics and provenance.
- [PARAMETER_AUTHORITY.md](PARAMETER_AUTHORITY.md) — parameter identity and authority rules.
- [QUALITY.md](QUALITY.md) — Quality/Evidence/Replay/Release boundary.
- [QUALIFICATION_GATES.md](QUALIFICATION_GATES.md) — external qualification gates.
- [UI_WORKFLOW.md](UI_WORKFLOW.md) — Program/Recipe/client execution and recovery.
- [VENDOR_ADAPTER.md](VENDOR_ADAPTER.md) — vendor isolation boundary.

## Golden-spec rule

This directory is a specification foundation, not a hardware qualification record. Unknown, model-specific or production-specific values remain explicitly gated rather than guessed.

## Completion status

The eight current feature entries have detailed non-numeric execution specifications. Remaining authoritative inputs include concrete device/model behavior, approved calibration/metrology evidence, production thresholds, safety constraints, and vendor SDK contracts.
